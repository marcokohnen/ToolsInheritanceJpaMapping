#Logging
#By default, Spring Boot logs only to the console and does not write log files. If you want to write log files
#in addition to the console output, you need to set a logging.file OR logging.path property
#(for example, in your application.properties).
#The following table shows how the logging.* properties can be used together:
#
#logging.file	logging.path	Example	Description
#  (none)           (none)      Console only logging.
#Specific file      (none)        .var/log/my.log       Writes to the specified log file. Names can be an exact location or relative to the current directory.
#  (none)      Specific directory   ./var/log           Writes spring.log to the specified directory. Names can be an exact location or relative to the current directory.

#logging.file=./logs/toolsApp-logging5
